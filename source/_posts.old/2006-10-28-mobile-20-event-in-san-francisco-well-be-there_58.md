The "mobile2.0 conference" is a one-day event organized and hosted by Daniel Appelquist (<a href="http://mobilemonday.org.uk/">Mobile Monday London</a>), Mike Rowehl (<a href="http://www.mobilemonday.us/">Mobile Monday Silicon Valley</a>) and Gregory Gorman (<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/">The Open Group</a>).

    We actually planned to be in San Francisco from the middle of November, but re-scheduled because of this event. <a href="http://logopoeia.com/about/">Michael(tm) Smith</a> form Opera will also be there - I met him at this year's <a href="http://xtech06.usefulinc.com/">Xtech conference in Amsterdam</a> where I presented the CarCulatr - our first mobile AJAX web application based on the <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/platform/">Opera Platform</a>.

    We're eager to meet as many people as possible from the mobile web industry, for example Tony Fish, since we recently purchased his <a href="http://www.mobileweb20.futuretext.com/">book on "Mobile Web 2.0"</a> (written with <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/Ajit%20Jaokar">Ajit Jaokar</a>) we purchased recently.

    Please get in touch with us, if you wanna meet up during or after the conference - we'll be in San Francisco until early December. After that we will head towards Boston where I will attend this year's <a href="http://2006.xmlconference.org/">XML Conference</a> - this time as co speaker, but more on that later on.
