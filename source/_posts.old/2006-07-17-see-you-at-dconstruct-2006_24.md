[d.Construct 2006][1] is a one-day web conference in Brighton, England, on the 8th of September. It is organized by the nice guys from [Clearleft][2], namely [Jeremy Keith][3], [Andy Budd][4] and [Richard Rutter][5]. 

To quote from the [website][1], d.Construct "... discusses how new technology is transforming the web from a document delivery system into an application platform." So it seems we're going to be at the right place - also for (mobile) web applications! 

We are looking forward to seeing many people from the [atmedia event this year][6] and we hope to get in touch with many new people in the mobile area as well.
