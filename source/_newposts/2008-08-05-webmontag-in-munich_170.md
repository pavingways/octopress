Yesterday we attended the [Webmontag][1] at [Optaros][2] in Munich. Nice people, interesting event, relaxed atmosphere and you always meet new people, but also see familiar faces ... like Claudia ([CScout][3]), [Georg][4] and Raju. Before the networking part started, there were some presentations. Since we were a bit late, we only catched the rest of Hartmut's presentation about WTF ([World Tag Framework][5]). Flash developers out there, please check out this stuff! BarCamp was presented by Nils - in general and especially the [one in Munich][6] and the [one for women][7] coming soon. After this presentation Magdalena did a small introduction to [Netvibes'][8] widgets. The last presentation held by our friend Raju from Optaros (formerly at OpenLaszlo) was about E-Commerce and WebTV. He gave us some insights about IPTV and how video and multimedia can improve and enhance e-commerce/online shopping. <!--more-->When the final presentation was over, the networking part started. We had a nice talk with Igor and Thomas. Igor is the founder of 

[flaMap][9], a visual social network, and Thomas is founder of the job portal [Spirofrog][10]. All in all: great event! Many thanks to Martin, Raju and the other helpers for organizing this event.
