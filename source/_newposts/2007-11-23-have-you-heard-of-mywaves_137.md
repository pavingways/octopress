<a href="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/mywaves.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right" title="mywaves.jpg"><img src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/mywaves.jpg" alt="mywaves.jpg" /></a> I read an interesting article on [us.blognation.com][1] about [**mywaves**][2], a mobile video service. mywaves was founded at the end of 2006, is led by a team that includes veterans from [Yahoo][3], [Napster][4], [Danger][5], [PayPal][6] and [TiVo][7] and is financially backed by [Menlo Ventures][8].The Sunnyvale, California based company revealed some quite impressive numbers. mywaves reported **1.25 million visitors per month**. Honestly, I didn't know that there is **already** such a big market for mobile video out there. According to [their press release][9] they got **an average of 4 visits per month per individual**. These visits lasted **an average of 20 minutes**. **How does it work?** First you have to sign-up for the service. Then you can discover, choose and personalize your on-the-go entertainment on their website that will be automatically delivered and updated to your mobile phone. mywaves also sends text messages alerting you about content updates in their channels. The service is free and works globally across all 3G, EDGE, BREW and EV-DO carriers as well as most video-capable mobile phones. **Marketing** In May 2007 they [announced][10] their partnership with [Admob][11] to enable click-to-video advertisements for AdMob advertisers.In July 2007 mywaves [announced][12] that [Alltel Wireless][13] will be the first North American carrier who launches mywaves service allowing Alltel customer to watch videos from their phone for 3.99 USD per month. Customers can easily download the application from their phone via the Alltel Axcess Shop and customize the content. **Sources: **<http://www.mywaves.com>[http://us.blognation.com][1]
