- **Mobile TV** **via DVB-H** will start in Germany on June 1, 2008 - just in time for the European Championship in Soccer. There is still a lack of content which has to be adapted for the small screen sizes. It will be interesting to see if this version of mobile TV will be successful. - **China Mobile**, China's largest mobile operator, called off **iPhone** launch negotiations with Apple. Supposedly the negotiations were cancelled due to disputes about Apple's share in downloads and other content sales. - **Nokia** is to close its German plant. The closure of the Bochum facilities is planned for the middle of this year. The production will be shifted to more competitive locations (such as Romania and Hungary). - **Google** has got the approval by the FCC (Federal Communications Commision) and is now one of the 214 qualified bidders for the 700Mhz frequency spectrum auction starting on Jan. 24, 2008. **Sources:** <http://www.golem.de/0801/57045.html> (Mobile TV), <http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/101733> (iPhone), <http://blog.wired.com/business/2008/01/china-mobile-an.html> (iPhone), <http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/101797> (Nokia), [http://www.golem.de/0801/57012.html][1] (Nokia), [http://www.engadgetmobile.com][2] (Nokia), [http://www.ft.com][3] (Nokia), [http://www.informationweek.com][4] (Google/FCC), <http://www.golem.de/0801/57029.html> (Google, FCC)
