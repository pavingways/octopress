[<img class="alignright" title="Frankfurt Book Fair 2009" src="http://www.buchmesse.de/img/startnavi_fbm2009_en.gif" alt="" width="270" height="270" />][1]I have been invited by the organizers of the [Frankfurt Book Fair][2] for a panel discussion about digital and mobile solutions in the field of cooking and publishing. For the first time, the Frankfurt Book Fair is offering over 400 qm exclusively to the world of food, wine and all things epicurean. The [Gourmet Gallery][3] (in Hall 5.0), one of the highlights at the book fair, features a show kitchen for live demonstrations by prominent chefs as well as talks, discussions, interviews etc. about everything cooking- and gourmet-related. The topic of the panel discussion that I am participating in is "[**Cooking digital, digital Cooking: digital innovations and initiatives**][4]". It is a B2B talk where we want to discuss examples for new ways for cookery books, trends, innovations and business models for chefs or publishing representatives. We will also talk about electronic culinary schools and getting recipes on your mobile. Insights from the huge amount of mobile application stores and the emerging mobile widgets market will be things I can contribute, and findings from our research on these topics will come in handy, so I hope. In case you haven't seen our wiki yet, it's the place where we collect all [available information about app stores and widget][5] engines - our main area of business meanwhile. It's my first time at the Frankfurt Book Fair and I am really looking forward to this interesting panel. Many thanks to [Heike Scholz][6] [@MobileZeitgeist][7] for getting me in touch!
