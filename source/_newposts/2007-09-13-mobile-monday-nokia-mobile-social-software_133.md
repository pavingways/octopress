Last Monday it was time for another [Mobile Monday in the Silicon Valley][1]. This time the Mobile Monday took place at [Nokia's Research center in Palo Alto][1]. I am not sure why, but this time there were much more people than last time. I even heard they had to turn away some people because there was not enough space. A compliment to Nokia: there was enough food and drinks for the rest of us who came in :) One thing that was annoying was the registration procedure that required two signatures and showing of your ID in order to get in, all supervised by 4 Nokia security guards. The Mobile Monday started at 7:00 pm with ab. 30 minutes of networking before presentations started. This time [Nokia (Mosh)][2], [Bebo][3] and [Loopt][4] presented about their services. Too bad that the guys from [Rabble][5] didn't make it. Unfortunately, there was nothing really new in any of the presentations, they were more or less product pitches with little technological background or helpful insights. But since there were so much attendees, it was a great opportunity for networking. All in all it was a good event and I did not want to miss it. By the way we are planning to do a barcamp-style mobile event at the end of October in Germany, probably somewhere in Munich. If you are interested in setting this up or would like to participate, please let us know!
