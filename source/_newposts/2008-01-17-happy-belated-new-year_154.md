In the first post this year we wish all of you a happy and successful year 2008! We have not blogged in a while. The good thing about this is that we were busy working on our first product, Groupile. [Groupile][1] will be a productive networking tool for groups. It is going to be ubiquitous, mobile-focused and web based. There will be a beta test soon, so make sure you sign up for that at [groupile.com][1]! Another thing that we've been working on was [our Mobile Ajax Library, Frost][2]. We booked a domain for the project and installed a very basic homepage. [http://frostlib.org][3] will from now on be the [official home of the Frost library][3] providing all the available information about the project. A pre-release version of the library is available for download there too.
