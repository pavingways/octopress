The event is organized by [IIR Telecoms][2] and they asked me to chair the sessions on Monday 03/31/2008. The topic for my introduction for that day is 'Mobile Web 2.0'. I'll start learning all the buzz words of the past 3 years by heart over the weekend to be prepared ;) Maybe I can slip in a little announcement concerning the long awaited launch of the[ Groupile Beta][3] that's due in April. We have about 140 people waiting, they signed up without really knowing what to expect, some of them are waiting since last year. April will clear things up. The conference is gonna be a big opportunity to network and get in touch with many great people in the mobile and mobile web area. The speaker roster looks great even though [CTIA/IEEE WCNC 2008 in Las Vegas][4] is at the same time. On Monday the following companies will be presenting and hold a roundtable discussion at the end of the day: 

*   [Google YouTube][5]

*   [Bluenove/Orange][6]

*   [trutap][7]

*   [Cyworld][8]

*   [itsmy.com][9]

*   [Yahoo!][10]

*   [emap][11]

*   [Zed][12]

*   [Telecom Italia][13]

*   [Eyeka][14]

*   [blinkBox][15]

 The W3C, Jamba and many international carriers will also be there and present throughout the conference. We're looking forward to meet you there, too!
