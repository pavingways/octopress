If you can't hear words like "Facebook", "social", "networking", "friends" or "community" anymore, then maybe you should have a look at the antisocial networking site [**Bugroff**][1]. [![bugroff.jpg][3]][3] This "website" has launched by Gray Dring - the person behind the [Clever Little Pod][3] comedy podcast. No wonder why Bugroff is nothing more than a spoof service :) Source: [http://uk.blognation.com][4]
