O2 and Vodafone have launched their new payment service "[mpass][1]" in Germany. Through mpass mobile phone customers with any German provider now have access to secure online shopping on their mobile phone or PC. mpass combines the direct debiting system (German: Lastschriftverfahren) with SMS payment confirmation through mobile phones ([we blogged about this before][1]). Some companies like Cinemaxx, Blume2000.de or Beate Uhse are already supporting the service. More about mpass here: <http://www.mpass.de/> Source: [zdnet.de][2]
