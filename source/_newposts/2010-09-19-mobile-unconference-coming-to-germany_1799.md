As you might have seen we collect and 

[blog about many different events][1]. **This event is special, because we are helping to organize this one!** [<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1496" title="mobile_unconference" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/mobile_unconference1.png" alt="" width="413" height="198" />][2] The [Mobile Unconference][2] is a one-day event, a bit like a [BarCamp][3], a bit like a conference, entrance free or very low (around 30 EUR). Our goal is to bring developers together in a very informal way and give those who want to share their story the possibility to take the microphone and do a presentation, so: 

*   anyone can come, as a speaker or just as a guest

*   sessions can be submitted before the conference

*   anyone can take the stage and can do a session at the event

*   there will be a schedule to sign up for a session during the event

*   sessions can be anything: talks, workshops, discussion rounds, artistic performances ;)

*   product pitches are strictly forbidden

*   cool stories about your experiences developing mobile applications or doing business in the mobile space are very welcome

*   networking is encouraged

*   there will be free food and drinks

 We went to the 

[Mobile Unconference in Rotterdam this May][4] and came back with the impression of a really cool event and many contacts to developers from the Netherlands - an overall great experience. Now we joined forces with [Syntens][5] and are bringing the [Mobile Unconference][6] to Germany. The event is targeted to take place in early November in D端sseldorf. The location allows us to invite attendees from Holland, we are even planning to hire a bus from Utrecht to D端sseldorf to make traveling simple and fun. With this event we want to fuel innovation and cooperations between Dutch and German developers/companies and hopefully some more attendees will join in from Sweden and Denmark (we're working on this). If you want to be a part in this, you can help us now! Specifically we need: 

*   attendees - can you make it to D端sseldorf in early November? Do you know anyone that might be interested in coming?

*   sessions - do you have an interesting story to tell, want to do a workshop?

*   location - we need a location, can you recommend anything in D端sseldorf?

*   sponsors - do you want to support us or know someone wo has some sponsoring budget?

*   news coverage - please tell anyone you know about this!
