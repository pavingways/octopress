- <a HREF="http://www.vodafone.de/">Vodafone</a> sued <a HREF="http://www.t-mobile.de/">T-Mobile</a> in Germany over its exclusive contract with Apple. That's why Vodafone had issued a "restraining order" against T-Mobile for offering the iPhone exclusively. Another German carrier <a HREF="http://www.debitel.de/">Debitel</a> had also complained to the German telecommunications regulators about the exclusive deal (which ties the iPhone to a single carrier). T-Mobile announced yesterday that they will now **also** sell the iPhone in Germany **without the 24-month contract** as well as **without SIM lock**. T-Mobile's unlocked iPhones (without a contract) will cost **999 EUR** (1473 USD). Customers who sign up for a 2-year T-Mobile contract get the device for 399 EUR (588 USD) plus (at least) 49.99 EUR/month. - The new version of the mobile Opera browser - **Opera Mini 4** - was released on Nov. 7th and had already had **over 1 Mio. downloads in the first ten days**. Incredible! Congratulations to the Opera team!
