<img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/net164cover130.gif" alt="" />As [previously mentioned][1] I wrote an article about Mobile Ajax for [UK's .net magazine][2] earlier this year. The article got postponed but now finally appeared in the July issue of the magazine. Thanks go out to Oliver Lindberg and the rest of the .net staff. Make sure you buy a copy of issue 164 and check out pages 106/107. ![Rocco Georgi Mobile Ajax in .net magazine][3]
