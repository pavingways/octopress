In its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Sept. 27, Apple sold 6.9 million iPhones and has now sold more than 13 million iPhones this year (Apple's sales goal was 10 million in 2008). Compared to Apple, RIM has sold 6.1 million Blackberry devices in the quarter ended August 30. "RIM is a good company that makes good products and so it is surprising that after only 15 months in the market we could outsell them in any quarter," Apple CEO Steve Jobs said during an analyst conference call following the release of the financial report. Jobs also said that Apple was the third-ranked mobile phone supplier worldwide by revenue during the quarter. **Sources:** [eetimes.com][1] [theglobeandmail.com][2] [golem.de][3]
