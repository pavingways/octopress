**UPDATE:** We will meet on Thursday (05/26) at 7 pm at Affentor-Schänke Neuer Wall 9 60594 Frankfurt [www.affentor-schaenke.de][1] \---|\---|\---|\---|\---|-- Just a quick reminder: we are holding our first PhoneGap & HTML5 Meetup this Thursday in Frankfurt/Main. Last year we already held a couple of HTML5 Meetups. This year we want to focus more on the mobile part: mobile development and [PhoneGap][2]. [Nitobi][3], the guys from PhoneGap, will support our Meetup group and hopefully we get some cutting-edge insights from the PhoneGap project. Anyone is invited to join our informal group. We are holding our next Meetup in a Ebbelwoi restaurant in a relaxed atmosphere. Demos or small presentations are welcome. The final location will be announced soon. If you wanna join us on Thursday (May 26th), please sign up here: [Meetup.com][4] [Xing][5] [Facebook][6]
