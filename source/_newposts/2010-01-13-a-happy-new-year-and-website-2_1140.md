We just wanted to take the opportunity of the beginning new year to wish all our readers all the best for this year and the new decade! We are in the process of changing our website design and content. The new page will contain more information about what we have been doing lately and what we will be doing soon - all in the area of games, [mobile widgets and app stores][1]. Because of this there was not much happening here during the last few weeks, except maybe useless filler posts like this one. But it's gonna be better soon, so please stay tuned!
