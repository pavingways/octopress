<img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/mwe.gif" alt="Mobile Web Americas" />I am [speaking][1] at the [**Mobile Web Americas**][2] conference, in October in Orlando, Florida. The Mobile Web Americas conference will take place 2 - 4 October 2007. I am pretty excited, because this conference is [all about the mobile web][3]. My presentation will be about "Pragmatic Mobile Ajax - an Ajax Library for constrained browsers in action". I am speaking about Mobile Ajax and how it can improve the user experience in mobile web applications. I will introduce the [Frost Ajax Library][4] as a tool for Ajax development on constrained browsers, such as those on mobile phones or gaming consoles. The session will show how and why the Frost library came to life and sheds some light on the underlying approach, which is quite different from other Ajax libraries. If you are attending or speaking at Mobile Web Americas too, and want to catch up, please let me know. There are still some spots open, so don't miss out this cool conference and [register][5]! See you there, Rocco
