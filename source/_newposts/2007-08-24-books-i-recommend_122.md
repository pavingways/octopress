The last couple of days we spent some time at Borders, a great bookstore. You have a really broad selection of books there and a cozy coffee shop inside, where you can read or do your work. I also love Amazon. So, the following list contains books from both retailers :) My list of great books that in my opinion really help starting your (web) business: 

*   [Guy Kawasaki: The Art of the Start][1]

*   [Guy Kawasaki: How to Drive Your Competition Crazy][2]

*   [Malcolm Gladwell: The Tipping Point][3]

*   [James Surowiecki: The Wisdom of Crowds][4]

*   [Mark Hughes: Buzzmarketing][5]

*   [Jessica Livingston: Founders at Work][6]

*   [John L. Nesheim: High Tech Start Up][7]

*   [Chris Anderson: The Long Tail][8]

*   [Keith Sawyer: Group Genius][9]

*   [Chris Murray: The Marketing Gurus][10]

 If you have read or know another must-read book, let me know!
