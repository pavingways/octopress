Yesterday we went to the 

[Bloggertreffen][1] in Munich which was loosely related to the [DLD][2]. Thanks to the sponsors Hubert Burda Media (the organizer of the [DLD event][2]), and [Telegate (11880)][3], every guest received an 18 EUR voucher. So, beer and food were free. It was a nice event and a good opportunity to meet some people (not only) from the German blogosphere. We had some interesting talks with people from the [CCC][4], [Focus][5], [Townkings][6], [BlogWerk][7] and [Xing][8]. Almost the whole [CScout][9] team was there too. Many thanks to [Klaus Eck][10] for organizing this event!
