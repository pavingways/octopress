March 28th will see the 2nd JavaScript User Group meeting in Frankfurt (JSUGFRA). I will do a little talk about different SDKs that enable you to bring your JavaScript application to many different platforms and devices, not in the browser but as an (almost) native app. iOS, Android, Nokia, BlackBerry, HP/Palm and even Samsung TVs will be covered. I'll try to do this as a hands-on demo actually putting a simple JS-powered app onto some devices/emulators. Here's the flyer: <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2198" title="JSUG FFM" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/JSUG_1.png" alt="" width="448" height="670" /> It's #1 because it started with #0 I suppose... Follow [@jsugfra][1] and [#jsugfra][2] and find [all details on Xing][3].
