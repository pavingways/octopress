As of February 1st there have been massive price drops amongst some of Germany's pay-as-you-go / prepaid offers such as [blau.de][1], [Symio][2] and [Aldi talk][3]. Aldi talk even offers UMTS / 3G SIM cards, so users can profit from the new cheap rates while using fast connections. All these [discount MVNOs][4] are using the network and infrastructure of [E-Plus][5]. Apparently E-Plus has dramatically lowered the reseller tariffs for data traffic. <!--more--> Other prepaid offers, such as 

[callmobile.de][6] or [klarmobil.de][7] which are based on the network of t-mobile did not lower their data prices, so there is now quite a gap between the cheapest offers from above and others. Users of the cheaper services now only pay **0,24 Cents per 1 MB**, whereas the more expensive providers charge **50 times as much**: 12 EUR per 1 MB! We think this is great news for everybody who wants to use his cellphone for receiving e-mails and for browsing and using the mobile web. It also had the effect that I already canceled my data option with my current contract operator and will completely switch to pay-as-you-go myself after my contract runs out in a few months.
