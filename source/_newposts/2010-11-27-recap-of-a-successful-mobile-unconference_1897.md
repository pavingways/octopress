Almost two weeks ago the [Mobile Unconference][1] took place at [Grey][2] in Düsseldorf. It was a great day, everything worked out well and as co-organizers we are happy about the positive feedback from our attendees - here is a short selection: 

*   "Congrats to all the #mobunc organization, very nice day, great location, good food, very interesting topics. All in all i'm happy I came :)" ([@pedrocustodio][3])

*   "Finally home, had an awesome time at #mobunc met lots of old mobile friends. Thanks for organising this guys!" ([@mahoekst][4])

*   "#mobunc was cool :-)" ([@ilgor][5])

*   "I have been at the Mobile Unconference Düsseldorf Edition today, a kind of BarCamp just a little bit more structured but as fun as any other I guess" ([@0m4r][6], [Blog][7])

*   "yeah, Mobile UNconference Düsseldorf was the best ever BarCamp I've attended. Very well organized by an international team!" ([Friedhelm][7], Comment)

 The event started around 10 am. The breakfast took a bit longer since we had to wait for the "

[Geek Bus][8]" from The Netherlands. They had internet connection, really good coffee, movies and a bar in this Microsoft-sponsored bus. After the Dutch attendees arrived the kick-off session with a funny introduction round started. The talks/workshops were determined and the unconference could get started. The topics were pretty diverse, but there were a lot about about cross-platform development ("My result: It's all about cross-plattform solutions!" [@danielrieber][9]). Here is a short overview: 

*   [Ripple Emulator][10] - a testing platform for developers to test their widget (from [@tinyhippos][11])

*   [apparat.io][12] - a HTML5 apps packager (from [Uxebu][13])

*   [Unify][14] - an open sourced smart phone framework, also check out [Unify Training][15] ([@fastner][16])

*   [KamiJS][17] - a cloud-enabled JavaScript platform for apps, widgets and digital homes ([Raju Bitter][18])

*   [Microsoft Windows Phone 7][19]

*   [WAC][20] - Wholesale Application Community

*   The [Vodafone Developer Day][21] alongside the Mobile Unconference

 Here's the whole schedule:

</p> All talks were pretty interesting and no one longer than 30 minutes. We had lively discussions as well. The Mobile Unconference can really be seen as a big success. We had over 100 (international) attendees and an overall nice atmosphere, which was carried over to 

[Tannenbaum][22] after the conference. Many thanks to all the other organizers and sponsors ([Enterprise Europe Network][23], [Microsoft][24], [Sevenval][25], [O'Reilly][26], [Syntens][27], [Mobile Games Blog][28], [Rotterdam Media Commission][29], [Codeglue][30], [Zenit][31]), all of our speakers and of course all the attendees for such a great day!

 We are definitely looking forward to the next Mobile Unconference which most likely will be held in Rotterdam again. See you there!
