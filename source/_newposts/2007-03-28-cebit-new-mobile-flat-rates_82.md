There are some interesting news from the [CeBIT][1] in Hannover, Germany (15.- 21. March 2007). The CeBIT is a leading business event for the digital world, and the mobile industry is an important part of the CeBIT. Especially this year is a lot of going on mobile + internet. Here are some facts: **T-Mobile:** [T-Mobile][2] has dramatically dropped their prices for mobile surfing. Here are the prices for their time- and volume-based rates. *time-based rates:* The time-based rate is called "[**web'n'walk**][3]". You only pay **0.09 EUR/minute** for the "web'n'walk Starter" rate. There is neither a basic fee nor a volume limit. In August 2007 T-Mobile plans to offer the "web'n'walk Surfer" rate with **120 minutes for 5.00 EUR**, which means 0.04 EUR/minute. *volume-based rates:* T-Mobile has also dropped the prices for their volume-based rates: "[web'n'walk BASIC][4]": 200 MByte for 20.00 EUR/month "[web'n'walk MEDIUM][5]": 400 MByte for 35.00 EUR/month "[web'n'walk LARGE][6]": 5 GByte for 50.00 EUR/month <!--more-->Besides this T-Mobile also offers a "

[**E-Mail Flat**][7]". You can send or receive as much emails as you want for a fixed price of **3.95 EUR/month**. You can retrieve up to 5 email addresses through the T-Mobile server, but you can not send email attachments. T-Mobile then only shows the name of the attached file. Using this service you need a cellphone with POP3-enabled eMail client. To make customers aware of their current web consumption T-Mobile from August 2007 will offer free pricing information via SMS. Customers will receive a SMS reminder for every 10 EUR they spent. At the end of the year 2007 T-Mobile also plans to introduce a monthly limit to the total costs of mobile web usage. This upper barrier is supposed to be aroun 100,- Euro per month for web'n'walk in your home country and 200,- Euro if you are using it in foreign countries. **O2:** [O2][8] offers a couple of new [mobile (time- and volume-based) rates][9] for their customers: *time-based rate:* For occasional usage of the mobile internet you only pay **0.03 EUR per minute** if you are in your Home-Zone, and everywhere else only **0.09 EUR per minute**. *volume-based rates:* Internet@home-Pack M: **1 GByte data volume for 10 EUR/month** for using the mobile internet in the Home-Zone Internet-PackM: **200 MByte data volume for 10 EUR/month** (no Home-Zone restrictions) Internet-Pack L: **5 GByte data volume for 25 EUR/month (**no Home-Zone restrictions) The minimum contract term of these rates is 3 months. You have to order the volume-based rates; the time-based rate is already activated in your contract. **Freenet:** [Freenet][10] also offers his customers a new mobile data flatrate. The mobile rate is called "[**freenetMobile Mail & Surf**][11]". For only **9.95 EUR/month** you have unlimited access to the mobile web. But there is a catch: at the moment Freenet only offers this rate to BlackBerry owners. Summary: Seems like the big players actively follow the trend towards mobile web usage. Now it's up to new service offerings to finally make a lot more people actually use the mobile web.
