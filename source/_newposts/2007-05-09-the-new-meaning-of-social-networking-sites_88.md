In recent years online social networks have experienced huge growth. Typically sites like 

[Facebook.com][1] or [MySpace.com][2] have been a place for the younger demographic in society to express personal interests and information. [The report "**Social Networking: Finding Friends Online**"][3] from [InStat][4] describes these networks as "virtual social structures consisting of individuals that are connected through various social familiarities, geographies, business connections, or common interests". In short: social networking sites are a great **place for self promotion**. But with tragedies like the tragedy at [Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007][5] it began to show that online social networking sites have become more important than just promoting yourself. They became a public place to mourn the loss. <!--more-->The meaning of social networking sites has changed. Earlier it was just a place to find old high school friends or to show the world your favorite band. But now it has "taken on a new dimension - as an instant outlet to join individuals on an entirely new level - 

**an emotional one**". Certainly social networking sites are getting more and more important on a emotional level. Even today people already use those sites to build their own private or work-related ([XING][6], [LinkedIn][7]) social network. Thus they become a meaning and they are not just a big hype. Soon we will also see a lot of **mobile social networking** services. With your mobile phone it is much easier and faster to get connected to your own social network (SMS, call, etc.) - wherever and whenever you want. I am also sure, that social networking services will get more and more important for companies, e.g. to organize a worldwide team, and that also the older demographic in society will use them.
