Hot, hot, hot up on the roof of the FamilyOven HQ on Jackson St. just on the border to Chinatown: a sunburn is what you can get if you stand up on a roof of a building (with a great view over the bay) with great weather during lunch time. You also can get in touch with many interesting people. I got both at Lunch 2.0 yesterday. Lunch 2.0 is a get-together of mostly web people in the Bay Area and it is usually hosted by a company that provides food and drinks for free. [FamilyOven][1] and their sponsors did a great job at this, they had incredible food and plenty of beer. I met Christen from [thumbble][2], [Terry Chay][3] (Lunch 2.0 organizer and [PHP hero][4]), ... Some people from [wired][5] were there too and seemed to like it as well they instantly [blogged about the event here][6] and included this image...I'm on it too. [![Lunch 2.0 @ FamilyOven][8]][8] By the way I have been told by two people during the event that the Risotto was actually the best they ever had.
