 We did a quick test on our N78 and N97 (we have a prototype) and all seems to work great now. Apparently the store was down this morning for a few hours (German time), probably due to the high load after all the press releases were published. In case you are looking for our 

[Panda Route Travel Planner widget][10] in the Ovi store - it will be available pretty soon, as it is in QA currently. We'll let you know as soon as you can start downloading it - it's even gonna be free for N97s! **Sources:** [reuters.com][11] [nokia.com][7]
