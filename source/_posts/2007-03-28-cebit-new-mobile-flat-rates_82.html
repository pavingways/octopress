There are some interesting news from the <a href="http://www.cebit.de">CeBIT</a> in Hannover, Germany (15.- 21. March 2007). The CeBIT is a leading  business event for the digital world, and the mobile industry is an important part of the CeBIT. Especially this year is a lot of going on mobile + internet. Here are some facts:<br>
<strong>T-Mobile:</strong><br>
<a href="http://t-mobile.de/">T-Mobile</a> has dramatically dropped their prices for mobile surfing. Here are the prices for their time- and volume-based rates.<br>
<em>time-based rates:</em><br>
The time-based rate is called "<a href="http://www.golem.de/0703/51082.html"><strong>web'n'walk</strong></a>". You only pay <strong>0.09 EUR/minute</strong> for the "web'n'walk Starter" rate. There is neither a basic fee nor a volume limit. In August 2007 T-Mobile plans to offer the "web'n'walk Surfer" rate with <strong>120 minutes for 5.00 EUR</strong>, which means 0.04 EUR/minute.<br>
<em>volume-based rates:</em><br>
T-Mobile has also dropped the prices for their volume-based rates:<br>
"<a href="https://www.t-mobile.de/business/datenoptionen/0,11575,16984-_,00.html">web'n'walk BASIC</a>": 200 MByte for 20.00 EUR/month<br>
"<a href="https://www.t-mobile.de/business/datenoptionen/0,11575,16985-_,00.html">web'n'walk MEDIUM</a>": 400 MByte for 35.00 EUR/month<br>
"<a href="https://www.t-mobile.de/business/datenoptionen/0,11575,16986-_,00.html">web'n'walk LARGE</a>": 5 GByte for 50.00 EUR/month<br>
<!--more-->Besides this T-Mobile also offers a "<a href="http://www.golem.de/0703/51080.html"><strong>E-Mail Flat</strong></a>". You can send or receive as much emails as you want for a fixed price of <strong>3.95 EUR/month</strong>. You can retrieve up to 5 email addresses through the T-Mobile server, but you can not send email attachments. T-Mobile then only shows the name of the attached file. Using this service you need a cellphone with POP3-enabled eMail client.<br>
<br>
To make customers aware of their current web consumption T-Mobile from August 2007 will offer free pricing information via SMS. Customers will receive a SMS reminder for every 10 EUR they spent.<br>
<br>
At the end of the year 2007 T-Mobile also plans to introduce a monthly limit to the total costs of mobile web usage. This upper barrier is supposed to be aroun 100,- Euro per month for web'n'walk in your home country and 200,- Euro if you are using it in foreign countries.<br>
<strong>O2:</strong><br>
<a href="http://www.o2online.de/">O2</a> offers a couple of new <a href="http://www.golem.de/0703/51070.html">mobile (time- and volume-based) rates</a> for their customers:<br>
<em>time-based rate:</em><br>
For occasional usage of the mobile internet you only pay <strong>0.03 EUR per minute</strong> if you are in your Home-Zone, and everywhere else only <strong>0.09 EUR per minute</strong>.<br>
<em>volume-based rates:</em><br>
Internet@home-Pack M: <strong>1 GByte data volume for 10 EUR/month</strong> for using the mobile internet in the Home-Zone<br>
Internet-PackM: <strong>200 MByte data volume for 10 EUR/month</strong> (no Home-Zone restrictions)<br>
Internet-Pack L: <strong>5 GByte data volume for 25 EUR/month (</strong>no Home-Zone restrictions)<br>
<br>
The minimum contract term of these rates is 3 months. You have to order the volume-based rates; the time-based rate is already activated in your contract.<br>
<strong>Freenet:</strong><br>
<a href="ttp://www.freenet.de">Freenet</a> also offers his customers a new mobile data flatrate. The mobile rate is called "<a href="http://www.pavingways.com/Also%20Freenet%20offers%20his%20customers%20a%20new%20mobile%20data%20flatrate.%20The%20mobile%20rate%20is%20called"><strong>freenetMobile Mail &amp; Surf</strong></a>". For only <strong>9.95 EUR/month</strong> you have unlimited access to the mobile web. But there is a catch: at the moment Freenet only offers this rate to BlackBerry owners.<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
Seems like the big players actively follow the trend towards mobile web usage. Now it's up to new service offerings to finally make a lot more people actually use the mobile web.<br>
