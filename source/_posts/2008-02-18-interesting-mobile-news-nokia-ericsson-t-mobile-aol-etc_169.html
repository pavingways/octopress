<strong>T-Mobile criticized Nokia's strategy</strong><br>
T-Mobile ain't very happy with Nokia's strategy offering more and more own services. Last summer Nokia announced <a href="http://ovi.nokia.com">Ovi</a>, a paid internet portal for music downloads and navigation. So Nokia breaks into a part of the value-added chain, which T-Mobile occupied until yet. T-Mobile boss Hamid Akhavan emphasized that Nokia's solo attempt will lead to conflicts.<strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/103265">http://www.heise.de</a><br>

<strong>T-Mobile cuts prices for mobile internet abroad</strong><br>
Last week T-Mobile announced 2 - still volume based - new tariffs which apply for all 27 EU-States:<ul>	<li>1 MB data traffic for 2 EUR</li>	<li>50 MB day package for 15 EUR</li></ul><br>
It will be irrelevant, in which foreign network a T-Mobile customer has signed in. Well, mobile surfing gets cheaper in Europe, but it is still very expensive.
