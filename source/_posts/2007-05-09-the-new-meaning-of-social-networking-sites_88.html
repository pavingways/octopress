In recent years online social networks have experienced huge growth. Typically sites like <a href="http://www.Facebook.com">Facebook.com</a> or <a href="http://www.MySpace.com">MySpace.com</a> have been a place for the younger demographic in society to express personal interests and information. <a href="http://www.instat.com/abstract.asp?id=212&amp;SKU=IN0703412CM">The report "<strong>Social Networking: Finding Friends Online</strong>"</a> from <a href="http://www.instat.com">InStat</a> describes these networks as "virtual social structures consisting of individuals that are connected through various social familiarities, geographies, business connections, or common interests". In short: social networking sites are a great <strong>place for self promotion</strong>.<br>
<br>
But with tragedies like the tragedy at <a href="http://video.nbc5.com/player/?id=92225">Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007</a> it began to show that online social networking sites have become more important than just promoting yourself. They became a public place to mourn the loss.<br>
<!--more-->The meaning of social networking sites has changed. Earlier it was just a place to find old high school friends or to show the world your favorite band. But now it has "taken on a new dimension - as an instant outlet to join individuals on an entirely new level - <strong>an emotional one</strong>".<br>
<br>
Certainly social networking sites are getting more and more important on a emotional level. Even today people already use those sites to build their own private or work-related (<a href="http://www.xing.com/">XING</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>) social network. Thus they become a meaning and they are not just a big hype.<br>
<br>
Soon we will also see a lot of <strong>mobile social networking</strong> services. With your mobile phone it is much easier and faster to get connected to your own social network (SMS, call, etc.) - wherever and whenever you want. I am also sure, that social networking services will get more and more important for companies, e.g. to organize a worldwide team, and that also the older demographic in society will use them.<br>
