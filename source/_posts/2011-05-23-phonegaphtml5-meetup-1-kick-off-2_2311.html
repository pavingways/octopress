<strong>UPDATE:</strong><br>

-----------------<br>
<br>
Just a quick reminder: we are holding our first PhoneGap &amp; HTML5 Meetup this Thursday in Frankfurt/Main.<br>
<br>
Last year we already held a couple of HTML5 Meetups. This year we want to focus more on the mobile part: mobile development and <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>. <a href="http://www.nitobi.com/">Nitobi</a>, the guys from PhoneGap, will support our Meetup group and hopefully we get some cutting-edge insights from the PhoneGap project.<br>
<br>
Anyone is invited to join our informal group. We are holding our next Meetup in a Ebbelwoi restaurant in a relaxed atmosphere. Demos or small presentations are welcome. The final location will be announced soon.<br>
<br>
