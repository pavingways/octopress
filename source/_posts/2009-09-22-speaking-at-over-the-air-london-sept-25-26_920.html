We are really looking forward to our next trip to London. This week is "<a href="http://www.londondigitalweek.com/">London Digital Week</a>" and we will be attending <a href="http://overtheair.org/">Over The Air </a> - 24 hour of mobile development, a mobile developer and design event. Too bad we knew about London Digital Week too late, so we will miss <a href="http://www.londondigitalweek.com/events.php">some other (mobile related) events</a>, such as <a href="http://mktools.forum.nokia.com/invitation/ovideveloperevent?cp=0809A&amp;entry=OviEventarticle7">Nokia Ovi Developer Open Door</a>.<br>
<br>
I am really happy that I am one of the speakers at <a href="http://overtheair.org/blog/about-over-the-air/">Over The Air 2009</a>. The line-up of speakers is great and the topics are impressive. There will be panels, sessions, discussions, workshops etc. - all about mobile development and design topics and there will also be an all-night hack-a-thon.<br>
<a href="http://overtheair.org/blog/session-portable-widgets/">My session "Mobile Widgets - Worth the hassle?"</a> focuses on comparing the <strong>different widget engines</strong> out there, on already existing and planned <strong>application stores</strong> and the question: <strong>is it worth to develop for one specific app store/engine or not</strong>.  I will also present an open wiki project collecting information about app stores and widget engines and invite the community to participate. Watch this space for update about this!<br>
<span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Due to overwhelming popular demand the organizers have released more tickets for Over the Air - register <a href="http://overtheair09.eventbrite.com/">here</a>. I think Over The Air will be THE mobile event this year packed with </span></span>a lot of bleeding edge knowledge to gain and interesting people in the mobile space to meet.<br>

If you are not able to attend, you can stay updated by following my tweets - <a href="http://twitter.com/GeeROC">@GeeROC</a> - and of course there will be a summary blog post right here too.
