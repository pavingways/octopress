As of February 1st there have been massive price drops amongst some of Germany's pay-as-you-go / prepaid offers such as <a href="http://www.blau.de/app?page=blau%2FTariff&service=page">blau.de</a>, <a href="http://www.simyo.de/de/tarif/uebersicht.html">Symio</a> and <a href="http://www.medionmobile.de/tarif.php">Aldi talk</a>. Aldi talk even offers UMTS / 3G SIM cards, so users can profit from the new cheap rates while using fast connections. All these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVNO#MVNOs_Classification_and_Marketing_strategies">discount MVNOs</a> are using the network and infrastructure of <a href="http://www.eplus.de/">E-Plus</a>. Apparently E-Plus has dramatically lowered the reseller tariffs for data traffic.<br>

<br>
Other prepaid offers, such as <a href="https://www.callmobile.de/services/prices.htm">callmobile.de</a> or <a href="http://www.klarmobil.de/tarif/index.html">klarmobil.de</a> which are based on the network of t-mobile did not lower their data prices, so  there is now quite a gap between the cheapest offers from above and others.<br>
<br>
Users of the cheaper services now only pay <strong>0,24 Cents per 1 MB</strong>, whereas the more expensive providers charge <strong>50 times as much</strong>: 12 EUR per 1 MB!<br>
<br>
We think this is great news for everybody who wants to use his cellphone for receiving e-mails and for browsing and using the mobile web. It also had the effect that I already canceled my data option with my current contract operator and will completely switch to pay-as-you-go myself after my contract runs out in a few months.
