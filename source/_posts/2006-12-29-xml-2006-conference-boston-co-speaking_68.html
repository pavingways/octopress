<img id="image70" style="float: right" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/xml2006.jpg" alt="xml2006.jpg" />Additional to <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/xml-2006-conference-boston-pecha-kucha-pechakucha_67.html">co-moderating</a> the <a href="http://2006.xmlconference.org/pechakucha.html">Vendor PechaKucha Night</a> at the XML Conference in Boston I also co-presented a talk on Mobile AJAX and the Mobile Web in general at the XML 2006 conference in Boston together with  <a href="http://2006.xmlconference.org/programme/people/1918.html">Michael Smith from Opera</a>.<br>
<br>
This was my first presentation at a conference except a <a href="http://xtech06.usefulinc.com/schedule/detail/206">lightning demo at this year's XTech conference</a> about CarCulatr (price finder for used cars to demo mobile AJAX using Opera Platform) and I have to say it could not have been worse...<br>
<!--more--> We learned a big lesson this day: prepare, prepare well!<br>
Michael planned on showing a demo of <a href="http://www.soonr.com/">Soonr</a>, one of the first Mobile AJAX applications (unfortunately only works on the Mobile Opera Browser) on a <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nseries/index.html?lang=en&amp;country=US#product,n93">Nokia N93</a>, which has a TV-out connector. He had the phone shipped to the hotel 2 days before, but unfortunately some clever guy at Opera forgot to include the TV-out cable. Unable top find a shop to sell those cables he ended up showing the mere phone to the audience and focusing more on his slides - oops there was the second problem.<br>
<br>
My crappy old laptop sometimes goes on standby and forgets that it it equipped with USB ports, so I fiddled around for about 10 minutes to reboot the thing and pull Michael's slides off a USB stick - oops third problem - the slides were not on it. Apparently Michael's somehow managed to not copy his slides to the USB stick and we ended up having nothing to start with.<br>
<br>
After Michael had expanded his introduction to about 20 Minutes, I continued with my presentation, which apparently went not too bad (haven't read otherwise yet). When I asked the audience if everybody knew "<a href="http://pc.mtld.mobi/">.mobi</a>" I was a bit surprised to hear somebody yell "<a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/TLD">dotmobi is evil!</a>" - as it turned out it was <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/">Paul Downey</a>. We ended up having a little discussion/explanatory session after my talk.<br>
<br>
Lessons learned, except the big one mentioned above, include that it is not as difficult as I had imagined it to be to present on a conference and that nobody will rip your head off if something goes wrong - not even at "<a href="http://2006.xmlconference.org/">The world's oldest and biggest XML conference</a>".<br>
<br>
I thank everbody at the conference commitee for allowing me to speak there and especially Michael for giving me this chance. I hope there will be more presentations to come, because it is just the best way to make yourself heard and to get people to respond to your thoughts.<br>
<br>
In my talk I was refering to our <a href="http://pwmwa.com/xml06/">Mobile AJAX demo application</a>, an event finder for the conference. Please read <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/expertise/mobile-ajax#mobile_ajax_test">this separate post</a> about it!<br>
