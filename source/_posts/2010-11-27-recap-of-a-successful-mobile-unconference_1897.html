Almost two weeks ago the <a href="http://www.mobileunconference.com/">Mobile Unconference</a> took place at <a href="http://www.grey.de/">Grey</a> in Düsseldorf. It was a great day, everything worked out well and as co-organizers we are happy about the positive feedback from our attendees - here is a short selection:<ul>	<li>"Congrats to all the #mobunc organization, very nice day, great location, good food, very interesting topics. All in all i'm happy I came :)" (<a href="http://twitter.com/pedrocustodio">@pedrocustodio</a>)</li>	<li>"Finally home, had an awesome time at #mobunc met lots of old mobile friends. Thanks for organising this guys!" (<a href="http://twitter.com/mahoekst">@mahoekst</a>)</li>	<li>"#mobunc was cool :-)" (<a href="http://twitter.com/ilgor">@ilgor</a>)</li>	<li>"I have been at the Mobile Unconference Düsseldorf Edition today, a kind of BarCamp just a little bit more structured but as fun as any other I guess" (<a href="http://twitter.com/0m4r">@0m4r</a>, <a href="http://blog.adobati.it/2010/11/mobile-unconference-dusseldorf.html">Blog</a>)</li>	<li>"yeah, Mobile UNconference Düsseldorf was the best ever BarCamp I've attended. Very well organized by an international team!" (<a href="http://blog.adobati.it/2010/11/mobile-unconference-dusseldorf.html">Friedhelm</a>, Comment)</li></ul>The event started around 10 am. The breakfast took a bit longer since we had to wait for the "<a href="http://twitpic.com/3721vc">Geek Bus</a>" from The Netherlands. They had internet connection, really good coffee, movies and a bar in this Microsoft-sponsored bus.<br>
 <br>
After the Dutch attendees arrived the kick-off session with a funny introduction round started. The talks/workshops were determined and the unconference could get started. The topics were pretty diverse, but there were a lot about about cross-platform development ("My result: It's all about cross-plattform solutions!" <a href="http://twitter.com/danielrieber">@danielrieber</a>). Here is a short overview:<ul>	<li><a href="http://ripple.tinyhippos.com">Ripple Emulator</a> - a testing platform for developers to test their widget (from <a href="http://twitter.com/tinyhippos">@tinyhippos</a>)</li>	<li><a href="http://apparat.io/">apparat.io</a> - a HTML5 apps packager (from <a href="http://www.uxebu.com/">Uxebu</a>)</li>	<li><a href="http://unify-project.org">Unify</a> - an open sourced smart phone framework, also check out <a href="http://unify-training.com/">Unify Training</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/fastner">@fastner</a>)</li>	<li><a href="http://www.kamijs.com/">KamiJS</a> - a cloud-enabled JavaScript platform for apps, widgets and digital homes (<a href="http://openfuture.rajubitter.com/">Raju Bitter</a>)</li>	<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/">Microsoft Windows Phone 7</a></li>	<li><a href="http://www.wholesaleappcommunity.com/default.aspx">WAC</a> - Wholesale Application Community</li>	<li>The <a href="http://developer.vodafone.com/">Vodafone Developer Day</a> alongside the Mobile Unconference</li></ul>Here's the whole schedule:<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1601" title="Mobile Unconference Schedule" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/mobunc-schedule11.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="531" /><p style="text-align: center;"></p><br>
 <br>
All talks were pretty interesting and no one longer than 30 minutes. We had lively discussions as well. The Mobile Unconference can really be seen as a big success. We had over 100 (international) attendees and an overall nice atmosphere, which was carried over to <a href="http://www.tannenbaum-duesseldorf.de/">Tannenbaum</a> after the conference.<br>
 <br>
