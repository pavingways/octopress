In Japan the browser powered by Opera is already available (since July 24, 2006). 

Taking advantage of the DS' built-in Wi-Fi capabilities the browser allows the user to<img align="right" alt="Nintendo DS cartridge" id="image37" title="Nintendo DS cartridge" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/nintendo-ds-with-cartridge.thumbnail.jpg" /> access the full internet, incl. webmail, online shops or secure bank websites. The browser will be sold as an optional DS card. Users simply insert the card into the Wi-Fi enabled Nintendo DS, connect to a network, and begin browsing on two screens. Users will also be able to apply an optional filter (provided by Astaro) that will block inappropriate content for underage surfers. The recommended retail price is around **GBP 30 / 40 Euros**.
