If you can't hear words like "Facebook", "social", "networking", "friends" or "community" anymore, then maybe you should have a look at the antisocial networking site <a href="http://www.bugroff.net"><strong>Bugroff</strong></a>.<br>

This "website" has launched by Gray Dring - the person behind the <a href="http://cleverlittlepod.com/">Clever Little Pod</a> comedy podcast. No wonder why Bugroff is nothing more than a spoof service :)<br>
