Yesterday we had quite a busy networking day. At lunch we met Alec from <a href="http://movoxx.com/"><strong>MoVoxx</strong></a> in Palo Alto. MoVoxx is a mobile ad agency focused exclusively on SMS marketing. The company already has some impressive customers, such as Mercury News in San Jose or NASCAR. You can find some case studies on the <a href="http://movoxx.com/clients.html">MoVoxx Website</a>.<br>
<br>
After a yummy lunch we drove to San Jose and were really enjoying the nice weather. It is so much warmer in the Valley than it is in San Francisco.<br>
<br>
Around 8:00 pm we went to the <strong>Silicon Valley Startup Entrepreneur Meetup Group</strong> organized by Philippe Tregon, which also took place in Palo Alto. It was an informal meeting with other founders, freelancers etc. of the Bay Area. After everybody had introduced themselves and why they had come to the Meetup, it was great talking to so many people coming from different business areas and with different intentions.<br>
<br>
Around 10:30 pm some people decided to go across the street to grab some food, unfortunately the probably best Greek spot in Palo Alto, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/1vMgajRAI3lYwuCeGX58oQ#hrid:FvJN6IZw0YqArSSSsovjOA/query:evvia">Evvia</a>, was closing already, so we ended up getting a coffee at Cuppa Coffee (free WiFi, power outlets and great coffee). We joined Tarun, Dan and Philippe and had a fascinating discussion about the mobile industry and the future of the Web itself. It was a real mind-opener in many ways.<br>
<br>
We took off to San Francisco at 1:30 am. Thanks to the Meetup organizers for the organization and the chance for meeting new people so easily. That is what makes the Bay Area so special.
