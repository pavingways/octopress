<span>I have been asked to do part of the technical review of a new book from </span><a href="http://www.apress.com">Apress</a><span> called '</span><a href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/9781430226208">Beginning Smartphone Web Development</a><span>' and was happy to help. </span><br>
<span>The book is written by </span><a href="http://learnthemobileweb.com">Gail Rahn Frederick</a> and from what I have seen so far the book is going to become a great introduction to mobile web development. All the necessary fundamentals are well covered and explained with practical examples and there are some more advanced sections on using Ajax and device capability databases.<br>
<br>
Anybody interested in the challenges and details of mobile web development can take away something from the book. Publication is due in December 2009, so make sure you put it on your <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Smartphone-Web-Development-Applications/dp/143022620X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1259427032&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon wishlist</a> now!
