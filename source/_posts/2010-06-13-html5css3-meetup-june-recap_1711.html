Our June meetup for HTML5/CSS hackers was a hot one! We had around 30 degrees around here, and were sweating like crazy. Drinking hot tea apparently is a good helper (thanks <a href="http://www.wibben.de/">Bj√∂rn</a>).<br>
 <br>
Again, less people attended than anticipated (learning there again). Luckily there were also two new attendees, thanks for coming <a href="http://grochtdreis.de/">Jens</a> and <a href="http://www.cschorr.de/">Christoph</a>!<br>
 <br>
The restaurant we picked was rather noisy, in part because they had all their windows open, which again also was rather unproductive air-condition wise...so maybe a restaurant is not a good place to do a tech meetup after all. That also did not help listening to <a href="http://twitter.com/akaRufus">Dennis</a> from Hamburg, who joined us to present a project over Teamviewer/speakerphone.<br>
 <br>
The project was pretty interesting though: Dennis is using a <a href="http://www.kaazing.com/">Kaazing</a> server for his Facebook-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game logic runs inside a JSP web application on the server and is using the Kaazing component for messaging with the clients. Clients connect either via a WebSocket connection (here's the HTML5 part) or a fallback mechanism using Flash. The only thing to do for the developer is to include the Kaazing iframe component into the HTML of the game. Kaazing itself is a Java-based and enterprise-oriented product. WebSocket capabilities with fallback mechanisms and simple integration into web applications are underlining this.<br>
Thanks Dennis for the demo! Unfortunately there is no version of this online, it's all only working on a local machine. By the way <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2010/01/kaazing-creates-custom-licensing.html">Kaazing apparently runs on the AppEngine</a>.<br>
 <br>
We also covered some other topics, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> was one of it. Opinions about using it diverted and some attendees were reluctant to it because it is ruby-based (workarounds are there) and because it forces you to learn another non-standard CSS language - valid points I think.<br>
 <br>
Jens was kind enough hinting us towards the <a href="http://webtechcon.de/">WebTech Conference in Mainz</a>, taking place October 11th to 13th. <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/">Christian Heilmann</a> is one of the speakers, so this surely becomes an interesting conference.<br>
 <br>
Finally we have been looking at some interesting HTML5-related links that I have been collecting lately. Here's the list:<ul>	<li><a href="http://happymagicfuntime.com/blog/html5_for_drunks">http://happymagicfuntime.com/blog/html5_for_drunks</a> (fun read)</li>	<li><a href="http://remysharp.com/2009/07/06/rimshot-with-html5/">http://remysharp.com/2009/07/06/rimshot-with-html5/</a> (audio bookmarklets)</li>	<li><a href="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js">http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js</a> (IE hack to enable HTML5 tags)</li>	<li><a href="http://html5.validator.nu">http://html5.validator.nu</a> (using Mozilla's HTML5 parsing Engine)<br>
