Earlier this week we started working from the <a href="http://citizenspace.us/">Citizen Space offices</a>. It is more efficient than working at coffee shops. We met <a href="http://horsepigcow.com/">Tara</a> and <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/">Chris</a> from Citizen Space there and a couple of other interesting people/companies. Everybody is very friendly and we really like the idea of coworking. Instead of sitting alone in an office you can meet lots of new and also international people.<br>

If you are in San Francisco and need a place to work, then you should definitely try Citizen Space located at 425 Second St on the third floor - make sure there's a place available by calling them before.
