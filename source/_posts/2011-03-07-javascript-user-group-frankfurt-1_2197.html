March 28th will see the 2nd JavaScript User Group meeting in Frankfurt (JSUGFRA). I will do a little talk about different SDKs that enable you to bring your JavaScript application to many different platforms and devices, not in the browser but as an (almost) native app.<br>
<br>
iOS, Android, Nokia, BlackBerry, HP/Palm and even Samsung TVs will be covered. I'll try to do this as a hands-on demo actually putting a simple JS-powered app onto some devices/emulators.<br>
<br>
Here's the flyer:<br>

<br>
It's #1 because it started with #0 I suppose...<br>
