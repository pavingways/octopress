Just a quick note to anybody who wants to reach our email addresses at PavingWays - they might be bouncing back due to a server crash earlier. We're in the process of transferring the site to a new host and DNS and MX entries are still interfering with the old and new server settings.<br>
<br>
So best way to reach us is by calling or sending a mail to my gmail address (if you have it ;) ).<br>
<br>
Should be resolved during the next couple of hours though...
