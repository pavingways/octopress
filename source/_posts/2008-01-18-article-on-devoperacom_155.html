I recently wrote an <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mobile-ajax-and-the-frost-ajax-library/">article for dev.opera.com</a> about Mobile Ajax and how the Frost Library can deal with that. There is a lot of introductory stuff in there and it might will be the longest and most comprehensive article I have been writing on the topic, there's even code snippets in there. So it might be a good read for anybody interested in the topic of Mobile Ajax.Thanks to David and Chris from Opera for making that happen and giving me the opportunity.You can read the <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mobile-ajax-and-the-frost-ajax-library/">article at dev.opera.com</a>.
