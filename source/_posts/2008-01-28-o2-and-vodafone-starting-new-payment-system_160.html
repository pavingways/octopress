<strong>O2</strong> and <strong>Vodafone</strong> are launching a new billing service in Germany this spring. The service will be accessible to every mobile phone user.<br>
<br>
The new payment system combines the direct debiting system (German: Lastschriftverfahren) with  SMS payment confirmation through mobile phones. That means:<ol>	<li>you order a product on a mobile portal or web shop</li>	<li>then you type in your mobile phone number and password</li>	<li>following you will receive a text message (SMS), which you have to confirm in order to debit the amount from your bank account via direct debiting system.</li></ol><br>
Prepaid customers and customers with cell phones provided by their company as well as customers of other carriers need to register once and for free for this online payment system.<br>
<br>
Due to the handling of payments via two independent communication media, the payment security will be clearly increased according to Vodafone and O2. A prior registration giving bank account details and credit card numbers does not apply.<br>
<br>
The whole payment service sounds very easy and promising. I am very curious about testing it.<br>
