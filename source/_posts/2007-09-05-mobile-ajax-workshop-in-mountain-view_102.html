After submitting a position paper, today I got my invite to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/06/mobile-ajax/">Mobile Ajax workshop in Mountain View</a> in late September (28th). I am really looking forward to this since it is one of the rare events that focus exclusively on Ajax on mobile devices and many important and interesting people that are involved in this topic are likely to be present. It's also the first workshop (= not conference) on this topic. So I am very excited and happy to have the chance to attend this event and meet everybody.<br>

My <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/positionpaper_moa_workshop_public.pdf" title="Mobile Ajax Workshop Position Paper Rocco Georgi">position paper is about the Frost Ajax library</a>. The only <a href="http://www.coactus.com/blog/2007/08/mobile-ajax-workshop-position-paper/">other position paper I have come accross</a> is the one from Mark Baker of <a href="http://www.coactus.com/" title="Coactus Consulting">Coactus Consulting</a>. It's entitled "<a href="http://www.coactus.com/blog/2007/08/mobile-ajax-workshop-position-paper/">The best mobile Ajax application is the one that's never written</a>", so there's probably gonna be some interesting discussions.
