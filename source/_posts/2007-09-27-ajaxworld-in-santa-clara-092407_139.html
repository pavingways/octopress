Last week I received an invitation for the "<a href="http://www.ajaxworld.com/general/sessions0907.htm">AJAXWorld Conference &amp; Expo 2007</a>" in Santa Clara, organized by <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/">SYS-CON Media</a>. I got an expo pass an could attend the keynotes and get on the expo floor for free. That's because I am apparently registered as a contributor back from earlier this year when we published the <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/products/mobile-ajax/mobile-ajax-faq">Mobile Ajax FAQ</a>. So I went to AjaxWorld on Monday.<br>
<br>
I ended up at a talk by <a href="http://www.ajaxworld.com/general/sessiondetail0907.htm?id=147">Michael Carter</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)">Comet</a> and a product called <a href="http://brbx.com/orbited/">Orbited</a>. Interesting stuff and in fact I was not aware that such a big chunk in Comet is related to the server, not the client. The expo floor was rather big with many big companies presenting amongst smaller ones. I had anice introduction to <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a>, and enjoyed the cozy sitting-bags provided by Oracle. Even WiFi worked after lunch, which was by the way also very good.<br>
<br>
At lunch I met Alex Russell of <a href="http://www.sitepen.com/">Sitepen Inc.</a>, a.k.a. creator of the <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">dojo Ajax toolkit</a>. He seemed interested when I told him about Frost and he'll probably also attend the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/06/mobile-ajax/">Mobile Ajax workshop on Friday</a>. I ended up sitting at the table of the dojo bunch. It appears that dojo is the framework of choice for big companies. At the booth of IBM I learned that they chose dojo, because of it's extensibility and overall great performance. Sun is also using it in an upcoming product.<br>
<br>
Back in the expo room I also met <a href="http://blog.maxcarlson.com/">Max Carlson</a>, founder and original creator of <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/">OpenLazlo</a>. We talked quite a while and I hope we will stay in touch. OpenLazlo was also Diamond sponsor of AjaxWorld and they provided for a lot of the free food and drinks - thank you for that. I unfortunately missed the party in the evening.<br>
<br>
I also realized that our <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/products/mobile-ajax/mobile-ajax-faq">Mobile Ajax FAQ</a> was printed in the AjaxWorld magazine that was availbale for free at the conference - nice. Overall it was a fun day and a good conference, Ajax is big business now and has definitely arrived at the enterprise level.
