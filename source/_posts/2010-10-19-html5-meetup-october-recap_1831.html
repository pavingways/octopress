Mostly out of completeness reasons here is a little recap of our October 7th HTML5 Meetup:<br>
 <br>
This time 3 out of the 7 total attendees were there for the first time, so we might actually grow this meetup one day. But it was good as it was and we had some quite interesting topics. I just want to mention them here quickly (as far as I can remember):<ul>	<li>Book: <a href="http://books.alistapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers">HTML5 for Web Designers</a></li>	<li><a href="http://hbbtv.org/">HbbTV</a> and why it might be interesting for web developers</li>	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/webfonts">Google Web Fonts</a> (thanks to <a href="http://www.sbtheke.de/">Sven</a>!)</li>	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DZ1Y7M">Amazon Kindle</a> product presentation ;)</li>	<li><a href="http://github.com/madrobby/zepto">Zepto.js</a> - a minimalist JavaScript framework for mobile WebKit browsers</li>	<li><a href="http://joapp.com/">Jo</a> - HTML5 Mobile App Framework</li>	<li><a href="http://github.com/madrobby/vapor.js">vapor.js</a> - very fast and fun JavaScript tool</li>	<li><a href="http://unify.github.com/unify/">Unify</a> - JavaScript mobile application framework</li>	<li>CSS3 vs. Canvas animations (CSS3 wins)</li>	<li>Dextrose AG acquisition by Zynga (both win, <a href="http://www.dextrose.com/">they're hiring</a>)</li>	<li>(function(){}()) vs. (function(){})() (thanks <a href="http://www.wibben.de/">Björn</a>)</li></ul>It was a fun evening at <a href="http://www.cafebarbruecke.de/">Cafe Brücke</a> (their food is much better than their website). It was surprisingly full between 20:00 to 22:00, but quieter than our previous locations.<br>

Thank you all for coming and see you next time!
