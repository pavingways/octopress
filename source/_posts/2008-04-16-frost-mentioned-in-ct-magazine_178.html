As I was reading an <a href="http://www.heise.de/ct/08/07/006/">older issue (#7 in 2008 from 17.03.2008, current one is 9) of Germany's premier computer magazine c't</a> I spotted a mentioning of <a href="http://frostlib.org" title="Frost, an open source Ajax library for mobile browsers">Frost, our open source Ajax library for mobile browsers</a>.<br>
<br>
The issue's title topic was "The web in your hand" and the article starting on page 112 was about "Webdesign for Mobile Devices". On page 114 Frost is mentioned in one sentence. Yay!<br>
<br>
"Event the first JavaScript library for mobile browsers, that are getting increasingly mightier, has been released; Frost is supposed to make simple Ajax manipulations possible." the article reads (translated from German).<br>
<br>
Just a small clarification here: we're still trying to get the first real release out of the door, shame especially on myself for not bringing up enough time to get this thing done. Anyways good to know we're on the radar, stuff like this certainly encourages further developments, but time always is an enemy.<br>
