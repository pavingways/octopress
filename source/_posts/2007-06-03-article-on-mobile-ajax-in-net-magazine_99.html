<img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/net164cover130.gif" alt="" />As <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/expertise/mobile-ajax">previously mentioned</a> I wrote an article about Mobile Ajax for <a href="http://www.netmag.co.uk/">UK's .net magazine</a> earlier this year.<br>
<br>
The article got postponed but now finally appeared in the July issue of the magazine. Thanks go out to Oliver Lindberg and the rest of the .net staff.<br>
<br>
Make sure you buy a copy of issue 164 and check out pages 106/107.<br>
