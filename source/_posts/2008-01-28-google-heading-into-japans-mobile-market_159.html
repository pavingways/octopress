Last week, <strong>NTT DoCoMo</strong>, Japan's biggest mobile phone carrier with nearly 53 million subscribers, and <strong>Google</strong> announced their partnership that includes providing search services and search-related advertisement. The service is scheduled to be launching in spring 2008.<br>
Besides, other Google services will be made available for i-mode users, such as a pre-installed application of Google Maps on i-mode handsets.<br>
<br>
In the near future GMail, YouTube and Picasa will be also accessible through i-mode. In addition, in all upcoming NTT DoCoMo handsets with a capable HTML browser, Google will be set as starting page.<br>
<br>
NTT DoCoMo may also introduce handsets that will use Google's "Android" mobile software package in Japan - probably in the second half of this year.  Not very surprising since NTT DoCoMo is a part of Android's Open Handset Alliance.<br>
<br>
This partnership will give Google a better access not only to the mobile market, but also to the search engine market in Japan, where Google lags behind Yahoo.<br>
<br>
Mobile service subscriptions exceeded 100 million in Japan as of the end of 2007, with almost 70 million users accessing the Internet through their mobile phones.<br>
