O2 and Vodafone have launched their new payment service "<a href="http://www.pavingways.com/o2-and-vodafone-starting-new-payment-system_160.html">mpass</a>" in Germany. Through mpass mobile phone customers with any German provider now have access to secure online shopping on their mobile phone or PC.<br>
<br>
mpass  combines the direct debiting system (German: Lastschriftverfahren) with SMS payment confirmation through mobile phones (<a href="http://www.pavingways.com/o2-and-vodafone-starting-new-payment-system_160.html">we blogged about this before</a>). Some companies like Cinemaxx, Blume2000.de or Beate Uhse are already supporting the service.<br>
