Last Monday we've been to the <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.us/?p=178"><strong>Mobile Monday</strong> at the AOL building in Mountain View</a>. Too bad that we missed the <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.us/?p=179">Demo sessions</a> (we arrived a bit late). But still we met some interesting (mobile oriented) people there, like Donnie Flood from <a href="http://www.admob.com">AdMob</a>  or Tim Kay from <a href="http://www.boopsie.com/home/">Boopsie</a>, and many more.<br>
<br>
As expected the Mobile Monday in the Silicon Valley was more casual than it is in Germany and we definitely met more mobile startups here. We liked it very much. Not too much organization (no registration in advance), pizza for everybody, good location and you could get in touch with people easily.<br>
<br>
Still, the Mobile Monday in the Silicon Valley has not as many attendees as its German counterpart (but again, the crowd is differently structured). But it seems a better place for showing around your mobile apps, even if your are not a big player in the industry. Great event! More!
