 <a href="http://www.wizzl.com">Wizzl</a>, a Dutch company, is preparing to launch its <strong>all-in-one virtual phone</strong>. Users ("Wizzlers") can talk, chat, have direct access to live TV, Internet radio and web games. Or as written <a href="http://www.wizzl.com/intl/en/aboutwizzl/pressinfo/pressreleases">on their website</a>:<br>
<br>
"Wizzl has developed free communication software which will allow its users ('Wizzlers') to make free voice and video calls over the internet, and calls to local and international phones and mobiles from only 1.5 Eurocents per minute. And it doesn't stop there; with Wizzl's all-in-one virtual phone, Wizzlers will have direct access to live TV, internet radio stations and the most popular web games around. Personal photographs, music and videos will also be at users' fingertips."<br>
<br>
The official (worldwide) launch will be at <a href="http://www.gameplay.nl">GamePlay</a>, the largest game event of the Benelux, between 23 and 25 Nov. 2007.<br>
<br>
You can test their (Windows) software on your desktop PC here: <a href="http://www.wizzl.com/intl/en/download">http://www.wizzl.com/intl/en/download</a>. First-time downloaders get up to 10 minutes of free calling time to landlines and mobile phones across the world. Wizzler-to-Wizzler voice and video calls are completely free of charge. "The current beta version works on desktops and laptops only. In the very near future, Wizzl will also be available for mobile phones."<br>
