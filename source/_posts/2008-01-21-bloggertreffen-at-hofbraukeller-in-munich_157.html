Yesterday we went to the <a href="http://klauseck.typepad.com/prblogger/2008/01/bloggertreffe-1.html">Bloggertreffen</a> in Munich which was loosely related to the <a href="http://www.dld-conference.com/">DLD</a>. Thanks to the sponsors Hubert Burda Media (the organizer of the <a href="http://www.dld-conference.com/">DLD event</a>),  and <a href="http://www.11880.com">Telegate (11880)</a>, every guest received an 18 EUR voucher. So, beer and food were free.<br>
<br>
It was a nice event and a good opportunity to meet some people (not only) from the German blogosphere. We had some interesting talks with people from the <a href="http://www.ccc.de/">CCC</a>, <a href="http://www.focus.de/">Focus</a>, <a href="http://www.townkings.com">Townkings</a>, <a title="BlogWerk" href="http://www.blogwerk.com">BlogWerk</a> and <a href="http://www.xing.de">Xing</a>. Almost the whole <a href="http://www.cscout.com">CScout</a> team was there too.<br>
<br>
Many thanks to <a href="http://www.econcon.de/">Klaus Eck</a> for organizing this event!
