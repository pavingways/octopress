<a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/">d.Construct 2006</a> is a one-day web conference in Brighton, England, on the 8th of September. It is organized by the nice guys from <a href="http://www.clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a>, namely <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/">Jeremy Keith</a>, <a href="http://andybudd.com/">Andy Budd</a> and <a href="http://clagnut.com/">Richard Rutter</a>.<br>
<br>
To quote from the <a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/">website</a>, d.Construct "... discusses how new technology is transforming the web from a document delivery system into an application platform." So it seems we're going to be at the right place - also for (mobile) web applications!<br>
<br>
We are looking forward to seeing many people from the <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/">atmedia event this year</a> and we hope to get in touch with many new people in the mobile area as well.<br>
