Today I read an interesting post on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mobileburn.com/news.jsp?Id=2632">http://www.mobileburn.com</a>. China Mobile has outranked Vodafone as the world's largest mobile phone operator. It is really surprising, because Vodafone serves the worldwide market and China Mobile only the Chinese market. Latest figures indicate that China Mobile serves 200 million customers - Vodafone "only" 186.8 million.<br>
<br>
This just shows us how big the Chinese market is and how many opportunities it offers. Analysts are predicting that China Mobile will expand their business overseas in the next few years.<br>
