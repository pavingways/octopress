As you might have seen we collect and <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/great-mobile-events-coming-up_1406.html">blog about many different events</a>.<br>
 <strong>This event is special, because we are helping to organize this one!</strong><br>
 <a href="http://www.mobileunconference.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1496" title="mobile_unconference" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/mobile_unconference1.png" alt="" width="413" height="198" /></a><br>
 <br>
The <a href="http://www.mobileunconference.com/">Mobile Unconference</a> is a one-day event, a bit like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a>, a bit like a conference, entrance free or very low (around 30 EUR). Our goal is to bring developers together in a very informal way and give those who want to share their story the possibility to take the microphone and do a presentation, so:<ul>	<li>anyone can come, as a speaker or just as a guest</li>	<li>sessions can be submitted before the conference</li>	<li>anyone can take the stage and can do a session at the event</li>	<li>there will be a schedule to sign up for a session during the event</li>	<li>sessions can be anything: talks, workshops, discussion rounds, artistic performances ;)</li>	<li>product pitches are strictly forbidden</li>	<li>cool stories about your experiences developing mobile applications or doing business in the mobile space are very welcome</li>	<li>networking is encouraged</li>	<li>there will be free food and drinks</li></ul>We went to the <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/mobile-unconference-rotterdam-recap_1354.html">Mobile Unconference in Rotterdam this May</a> and came back with the impression of a really cool event and many contacts to developers from the Netherlands - an overall great experience.<br>
 <br>
Now we joined forces with <a href="http://www.syntens.nl/">Syntens</a> and are bringing the <a href="http://www.mobileunconference.com">Mobile Unconference</a> to Germany. The event is targeted to take place in early November in D端sseldorf. The location allows us to invite attendees from Holland, we are even planning to hire a bus from Utrecht to D端sseldorf to make traveling simple and fun.<br>
 <br>
With this event we want to fuel innovation and cooperations between Dutch and German developers/companies and hopefully some more attendees will join in from Sweden and Denmark (we're working on this).<br>
 <br>
If you want to be a part in this, you can help us now! Specifically we need:<ul>	<li>attendees - can you make it to D端sseldorf in early November? Do you know anyone that might be interested in coming?</li>	<li>sessions - do you have an interesting story to tell, want to do a workshop?</li>	<li>location - we need a location, can you recommend anything in D端sseldorf?</li>	<li>sponsors - do you want to support us or know someone wo has some sponsoring budget?</li>	<li>news coverage - please tell anyone you know about this!</li></ul><div>If so, then please:</div><ul>	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/pavingways/statuses/24962379968">Retweet this!</a></li>	<li><a href="http://www.pavingways.com/contact">Get in touch with us!</a></li></ul><div>Thank you very much and hopefully we'll see you there!</div>
