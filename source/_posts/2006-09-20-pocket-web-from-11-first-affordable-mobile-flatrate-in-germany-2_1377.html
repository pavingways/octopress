Today we received an interesting newsletter from 1&1 Internet AG, a German ISP. 1&1 now offers a <strong>Pocket Web Flat</strong> for <strong>9.99 EUR per month</strong> (powered by Vodafone). There are no time or volume limitations and no additional basic fee, the offer is valid until 30 September 2006.<br>
 <br>
The service comes with a mobile handset that lacks the ability to make regular phonecalls, except if you are using a bluetooth headset (and pay from 0.29 EUR/Minute) and can therefore be best described as a PDA with phone abilities. However it supports push E-Mail and sports a webbrowser which is "optimized for the mobile internet". It also has a calendar and a contact manager installed. There are no further information available about the platform or the software, so we will probably have to buy one of these to get more info.<br>
 <br>
Probably this whole offer is Vodafone's way to get real-life data about people using the mobile internet and to figure out if they could offer a mobile flatrate within their own data plans. At the moment what you get from Vodafone for 9.95 a month is 30MB and that's not a lot and quite a difference to a real flatrate or other offers - BASE offers a mobile flatrate for 25.00 EUR / month, but only if you are a BASE customer which makes another 25.00 EUR / month for   the voice service (also flat).<br>
 <br>
So let's hope the test works well and we'll see the mobile flatrate available as regular data plans soon.<br>
