<img src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/xtech_07.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"/>I am <a href="http://2007.xtech.org/public/schedule/detail/150">speaking</a> at this year's <a href="http://2007.xtech.org/">Xtech conference</a>, on the 17th of May in Paris, France. <br>
<br>
The Xtech, Europe's premier web technology conference, will take place 15 - 18 May 2007. The <a href="http://2007.xtech.org/public/schedule/speakers">speakers</a> include some famous people and I am looking forward to meeting some people and friends I met during other conferences before, especially <a href="http://2007.xtech.org/public/schedule/speaker/130">HÃ¥kon</a>, <a href="http://2007.xtech.org/public/schedule/speaker/106">Mike</a> and <a href="http://2007.xtech.org/public/schedule/speaker/30">Jeremy</a>.<br>
<br>
My presentation will be about "<a href="http://2007.xtech.org/public/schedule/detail/150">AJAX on mobile devices - making mobile web apps ubiquitous</a>".<br>
<br>
During my presentation I will try to show that AJAX can be used to improve the usability of mobile web applications and to solve some other problems, e.g. concerning bandwidth. Another point will be that due to the varying degree of browser support it is rather difficult to develop a universal application that runs on all the different devices out there. Some best practices will be explored and new approaches to JS frameworks paired with browser detection algorithms will presented using real-life mobile web applications.<br>
<br>
If you are attending or speaking at Xtech too, and want to catch up, please let me know. There are still some spots open, so don't miss out this cool conference and <a href="http://2007.xtech.org/public/content/register">register</a>! <br>
<br>
See you there, Rocco
