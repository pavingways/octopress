In the first post this year we wish all of you a happy and successful year 2008!<br>
<br>
We have not blogged in a while. The good thing about this is that we were busy working on our first product, Groupile. <a title="Groupile Homepage" href="http://groupile.com">Groupile</a> will be a productive networking tool for groups. It is going to be ubiquitous, mobile-focused and web based. There will be a beta test soon, so make sure you sign up for that at <a title="Groupile Homepage" href="http://groupile.com">groupile.com</a>!<br>
<br>
Another thing that we've been working on was <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/products/frost-ajax-library">our Mobile Ajax Library, Frost</a>. We booked a domain for the project and installed a very basic homepage. <a title="Official Homepage of the Frost Mobile Ajax Library" href="http://frostlib.org">http://frostlib.org</a> will from now on be the <a title="Official Homepage of the Frost Mobile Ajax Library" href="http://frostlib.org">official home of the Frost library</a> providing all the available information about the project. A pre-release version of the library is available for download there too.
