Yesterday we attended the <a href="http://www.webmontag.de/doku.php?id=muenchen">Webmontag</a> at <a href="http://www.optaros.de">Optaros</a> in Munich. Nice people, interesting event, relaxed atmosphere and you always meet new people, but also see familiar faces ... like Claudia (<a href="http://www.cscout.com">CScout</a>), <a href="http://www.portenkirchner.net">Georg</a> and Raju.<br>
<br>
Before the networking part started, there were some presentations. Since we were a bit late, we only catched the rest of Hartmut's presentation about WTF (<a href="http://www.wt-framework.com">World Tag Framework</a>). Flash developers out there, please check out this stuff! BarCamp was presented by Nils - in general and especially the <a href="http://barcampmunich.mixxt.de/networks/events/show_event.730">one in Munich</a> and the <a href="http://barcampmunich.mixxt.de/networks/events/show_event.978">one for women</a> coming soon.<br>
<br>
After this presentation Magdalena did a small introduction to <a href="http://www.netvibes.com">Netvibes'</a> widgets. The last presentation held by our friend Raju from Optaros (formerly at OpenLaszlo) was about E-Commerce and WebTV. He gave us some insights about IPTV and how video and multimedia can improve and enhance e-commerce/online shopping.<br>
<!--more-->When the final presentation was over, the networking part started. We had a nice talk with Igor and Thomas. Igor is the founder of <a href="http://www.flamap.de">flaMap</a>, a visual social network, and Thomas is founder of the job portal <a href="http://www.spirofrog.de">Spirofrog</a>.<br>
<br>
All in all: great event! Many thanks to Martin, Raju and the other helpers for organizing this event.
