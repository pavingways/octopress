A couple of days ago I went to <a href="http://www.bordersstores.com">Borders</a> and while wandering through the shelves I came across the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trump-University-Entrepreneurship-101-Machine/dp/0470047127/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/002-2329726-6324018?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1186429022&amp;sr=1-3">"Entrepreneuship 101" from the Trump University</a>. I bought it and started reading it immediately  at a cozy coffee shop inside Borders.<br>
<br>
Although I have not finished the book yet, it is very interesting and helpful. I wished the professors at my university had teached business management  so understandable. The book is a good guideline for startups with helpful practical examples.<br>
<br>
On page 27 I stumbled across an interesting quotation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakti_Gawain">Shakti Gawain</a>:<br>
<br>
"Your Life Is Your Work of Art<br>
<br>
I like to think of myself as an artist, and my life is my greatest work of art.<br>
Every moment is a moment of creation, and each moment of creation contains infinite possibilities. I can do things the way I have always done them, or I can look at all the different alternatives, and try something new and different and potentially more rewarding. Every moment presents a new opportunity and a new decision.<br>
What a wonderful game we are playing, and what a magnificent art form."
