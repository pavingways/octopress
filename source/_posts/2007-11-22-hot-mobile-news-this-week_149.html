- <a HREF="http://www.vodafone.de/">Vodafone</a> sued <a HREF="http://www.t-mobile.de/">T-Mobile</a> in Germany  over its exclusive contract with Apple. That's why Vodafone had issued a "restraining order" against T-Mobile for offering the iPhone exclusively. Another German carrier <a HREF="http://www.debitel.de/">Debitel</a> had also complained to the German telecommunications regulators about the exclusive deal (which ties the iPhone to a single carrier).<br>
T-Mobile announced yesterday that they will now <strong>also</strong> sell the iPhone in Germany <strong>without the 24-month contract</strong> as well as <strong>without SIM lock</strong>. T-Mobile's unlocked iPhones (without a contract) will cost <strong>999 EUR</strong> (1473 USD).<br>
Customers who sign up for a 2-year T-Mobile contract get the device for 399 EUR (588 USD) plus (at least) 49.99 EUR/month.<br>
